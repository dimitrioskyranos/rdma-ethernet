# RDMA- Ethernet code

Code developed for the RnD Embedded project. All code in this repo is developed by me (Dimitrios Kyranos), along with some help from my teammates (mentioned in the documentation).
The v1 part was taken from the ZCU102 - Ethernet examples: [https://github.com/Xilinx-Wiki-Projects/ZCU102-Ethernet/tree/main/2024.1]. However, this code was not used in any of the later iterations.
